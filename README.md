to achieve scalability and manageability. 

Enjoy automated scaling features for security services based on demand. Additional features include container health monitoring and automatic unhealthy container replacement, 
ensuring high availability during maintenance, surge conditions, and partial outages. Secure Firewall Cloud Native uses industry-standard Kubernetes orchestration to provide 
linear scalability and resiliency for security services and easy management of containers.

across your Cisco Secure Firewalls. It also saves you time by improving efficiency for repetitive security tasks. Whether you need to adjust security polices for 10 or 1000 firewalls,
